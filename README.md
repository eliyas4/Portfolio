# My Portfolio

## About me
Hi I'm Eliyas, and this is my web development portfolio. 

I am new developer currently working on honing my craft. This portfolio showcases some of my newest and best projects, as well as my design style. I enjoy designing bold and striking websites that grab the users attention while being easy to navigate. If you like my designs then my contact details are also present in my portfolio. 

## Usage 
This portfolio contains multiple clickable features. When a users cursor hovers over a clickable feature a blue glow will appear to let the user know they can interact. This feature is shown below.
